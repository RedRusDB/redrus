# Redrus a distributed in-memory k-v storage engine in Rust! 


Building a database from scratch has its own thrill, and you can leverage this to
build a database from scratch
learn database internals, starting with Redis
learn about advanced data structures, algorithms, and event loops
collaborate with other engineers and contribute back to Open Source

## NOTE: In development

- [x] REPL for kv store

<!-- 
While our B+ tree now support concurrent operations, it's still a single
threaded database system, as our frontend (network/cli layer) doesn't support
handling concurrent requests yet.

_This is by no mean an idiomatic Rust implementation as I'm learning Rust
along the way._

-----

The project is kind of slow phase coz i have job in parallel and am learning the things on the way. Hence, the progress will be slower.
Hopefully, I can regain my momentum after a couple of weeks._

----

## End Goal

The main focus to write a in momery storage engine from scratch. This project now
includes it's own B+ Tree data structure, buffer pool, LRU replacement policy,
transaction manager, and lock manager. -->
